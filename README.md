#### Sustainable Energy Choices of Finnish Citizens

Statistics Finland publishes yearly, detailed data on energy consumption by source and related greenhouse
gas emissions by fuel in Finland. The consumption and emission sources have different correlations between
them. We visualize two adjacent bar chart races where consumption and emission sources race from 1960
to 2018. This double bar chart race is controlled by timeline below. User can investigate timely trends with
focus on heat production, electricity generation, or transport fuels.
