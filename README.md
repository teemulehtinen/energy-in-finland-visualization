#### Sustainable Energy Choices of Finnish Citizens

Statistics Finland publishes yearly, detailed data on energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions in Finland. We visualize this data from 1960 to 2018 using a double bar chart race and a timeline control. User can investigate timely trends with focus on heat production, electricity generation, or transport fuels.
